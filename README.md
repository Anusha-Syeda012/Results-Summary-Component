## Overview
  The Task was to create the Results Summary Component, using any resources but here i have used the basic concepts 
  of HTML and CSS for my project. I have created it for the specified width screens for desktop view and laptop view
  that was mentioned in the README.md file of Frontend mentor. Moreover i followed there recommendations for font-size, font-family, font-weight , backround colors and etc.

### Screenshot
Here are my both Desktop and Laptop views of the Results Summary Component.

## My process
I have divided my task into three steps. First, I built the layout using Figma and structured my HTML. Second, I created custom CSS for the layout, incorporating necessary grid and flexbox settings, relevant fonts and font sizes, background colors, text alignments, images, favicon, etc. Third, I set screen sizes for each view (Desktop and Laptop). In the final step, I commented on the code to enhance understanding. Additionally, I maintained my repository on my GitHub account.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Selectors


### What I learned
I have learned many things and recalled my concepts related to web development. However, the most significant lesson I acquired was becoming more efficient and adept at work. Yes, we all acknowledge that HTML and CSS are integral components of design, and there are moments when we feel frustrated. Nevertheless, it is a part of the learning process that we must embrace. I want to highlight the individual whose YouTube tutorials and videos greatly assisted me â€” Kevin Powell. I will share the link to his YouTube channel so that you can also visit and learn CSS in a more intelligent and effective manner.

### Continued development
I will focus on tackling more challenges and aim to complete at least one challenge every week, focusing specifically on HTML and CSS. Simultaneously, I plan to enhance my coding skills, particularly in JavaScript, by consecutively completing 30 projects. This approach will allow me to immerse myself in continuous learning, progressively building and refining my coding abilities.



### Useful resources

- [For Understanding Grid and Flex-Box](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary) - This resource helped me to understand and implement the  grid view and flexbox.
- [For Media Queries in CSS](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-media-queries?utm_medium=content_acq&utm_source=css-tricks&utm_campaign=&utm_content=awareness_bestsellers#basic-media-queries) - This is an amazing website which helped me finally understand media-queries. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
